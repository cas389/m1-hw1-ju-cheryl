## Issues While Completing Assignment
I believe the hardest issue was getting my local repository pushed to GitHub. That took several tries in order to get it to work before I was successful.

## Outside Resources
The biggest outside resource I had was using my Project 3 from last semester in order to get the navigation bar responsive.

After that, I just used the notes from the recorded lectures in order to complete the assignment.
